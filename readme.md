# Hybrid Anime Recommender System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Hybrid Anime Recommender System project! This project is designed to provide personalized anime recommendations by leveraging a hybrid recommendation approach that combines user preferencies and content-based filtering techniques. The goal is to deliver accurate and meaningful suggestions to users based on their preferences and viewing history.

This project showcases a robust implementation of MLOps principles, integrating modern tools and technologies to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability.


## Features

- **Hybrid Recommendation Engine**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large datasets and user bases.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automated pipelines for seamless development and deployment.
- **Cloud Integration**: Utilizes cloud services for storage, computation, and deployment.


## Technologies Used

### 1. **Jenkins**
    - Automated CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and deploying the application.
    - Ensures code quality and reduces manual intervention in the deployment process.

### 2. **GitHub**
    - Version control system for collaborative development.

### 3. **Docker**
    - Containerization of the application for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
    - Simplifies deployment and ensures portability.

### 4. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
    - Cloud infrastructure for hosting the application and managing resources.
    - Services such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Cloud Storage, and BigQuery are utilized for scalability and data processing.

### 5. **Python**
    - Core programming language for building the recommendation engine.
    - Libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `tensorflow` are used for data processing and machine learning.

### 6. **Kubernetes**
    - Orchestrates containerized applications for high availability and scalability.
    - Manages deployment, scaling, and operations of the application.
